=== ACADEMIC WRITING FORMALITY ===

INFORMAL (Casual emails, personal blogs)
- Use contractions: I'm, we'll, can't
- Use first person: I think, we believe
- Conversational tone
- Use simple words and phrases

FORMAL (Essays, business reports, academic papers)
- Avoid contractions: I am, we will, cannot
- Use passive voice: "It is argued that..." instead of "I argue..."
- Objective tone, minimize personal opinion
- Use complex, sophisticated vocabulary
- No slang or colloquial expressions

EXAMPLE - INFORMAL:
"Social media is great because it helps people stay connected. I use it all the time, and I really like how I can message my friends."

EXAMPLE - FORMAL:
"Social media platforms provide valuable channels for interpersonal connection and communication. These platforms enable users to maintain relationships across geographical distances."

=== GRAMMAR FOR ACADEMIC WRITING ===

SUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT IN COMPLEX SENTENCES
"Neither the students nor the teacher [was/were] aware of the deadline."
- Correct: "was" (the teacher is singular, closer to verb)
- Rule: The subject nearer the verb determines agreement

WHICH vs THAT (Restrictive vs Non-restrictive)
- That (restrictive): "Employees that arrive late lose bonus points." (identifies which employees)
- Which (non-restrictive): "My supervisor, which is kind, allows flexible hours." (additional info)
- British: Increasingly flexible with this rule

PASSIVE VOICE FOR OBJECTIVITY
Active: "The researcher conducted an experiment."
Passive: "An experiment was conducted." (More academic)
Note: Use passive when focus is on action, not actor

CONDITIONAL STRUCTURES IN ESSAYS
Zero: "If one exercises regularly, one improves fitness." (General truth)
First: "If students attend classes consistently, they will achieve better grades." (Likely future)
Second: "If universities offered free education, more people would attend." (Hypothetical)

PARALLEL STRUCTURE
Weak: "The report was detailed, comprehensive, and it was well-researched."
Strong: "The report was detailed, comprehensive, and well-researched."
(All items in series match grammatically)

=== COMMA RULES FOR ACADEMIC WRITING ===

USE COMMAS FOR:
1. Introductory phrase: "According to recent studies, climate change affects ocean temperatures."
2. Separating independent clauses with conjunctions: "Some argue technology improves learning, while others cite its distracting effects."
3. Parenthetical information: "Mobile phones, despite their ubiquity, were not available 30 years ago."
4. Separating items in a list: "The study included observations, interviews, and surveys." (Oxford comma: recommended in academic writing)
5. Before transitional words: "Students need structure and guidance; however, excessive control inhibits creativity."

DON'T USE COMMAS FOR:
- Between subject and verb: "The research team [comma] discovered new patterns."
- Between verb and object: "The study shows [comma] that technology affects learning."

=== EMAIL WRITING ===

PROFESSIONAL EMAIL STRUCTURE

Subject Line
- Clear and specific: "Request for Meeting Regarding Q4 Budget" (NOT "Hi" or "Question")
- Informative but concise

Greeting
- Formal: "Dear Dr. Smith," or "Dear Ms. Johnson,"
- Semi-formal: "Hi John,"
- Too casual for business: "Hey" or "Yo"

Body
- First paragraph: State purpose clearly
- Middle: Provide details or context
- Last paragraph: Indicate what action is expected

Closing
- Formal: "Sincerely," or "Best regards,"
- Professional: "Thank you," or "Best,"
- Very casual: "Cheers,"

EMAIL EXAMPLE

Subject: Request for Deadline Extension - Project Submission

Dear Professor Williams,

I am writing to request a one-week extension for the final project due on December 15th. I have encountered unexpected difficulties with data collection that have delayed my progress.

I have already completed 60% of the work and have a clear plan to finish the remaining analysis. With the additional week, I am confident I can submit a high-quality project that meets your standards.

Would it be possible to extend the deadline to December 22nd? I would greatly appreciate your consideration.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson
