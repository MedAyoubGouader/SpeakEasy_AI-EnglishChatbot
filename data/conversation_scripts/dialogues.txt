Candidate: Your company has an excellent reputation for innovation, and I'm impressed by your recent projects. I believe my experience in agile methodology would be valuable to your team.

Interviewer: What are your greatest strengths?
Candidate: I'd say my organizational skills and ability to communicate across different departments. I'm also adaptable and handle pressure well.

=== PROBLEM SOLVING (B1-B2) ===

SCRIPT 13: Workplace Conflict
Manager: Can we talk about the project deadline?
Employee: Sure. What about it?

Manager: I understand that unexpected issues come up. However, it's important that you communicate with me when you run into problems so we can adjust the timeline.
Employee: You're right. I should have sent you a message when I realized the issue.

Employee: Absolutely. I'll send you a summary every afternoon. And I'll also give you a heads-up immediately if any problems arise.
Manager: That sounds good. Is there anything you need from me to help you meet the deadlines?

=== CASUAL CONVERSATION (B2) ===

SCRIPT 14: Discussing Hobbies
A: So, what do you like to do in your free time?
B: Well, I'm really into photography. I've been doing it for about 3 years now.
A: That's cool! What kind of photography do you do?
B: Mostly landscape and travel photography. I love capturing natural scenery and different cultures.
A: Have you traveled much?
B: Quite a bit, actually. I've been to 15 countries so far. I usually try to combine my travels with photography projects.
A: That sounds amazing! Do you make money from your photography?
B: Not really. It's still more of a hobby for me. Though I've sold a few prints online, which helps cover equipment costs.
A: Do you sell through your own website?
B: I do have a website, but I also use some print-on-demand sites. They handle the distribution and payment, which makes it convenient.
A: What equipment do you use?
B: I have a professional DSLR camera and a few different lenses. But honestly, you don't need expensive gear to get started. A good smartphone camera works great for beginners.

=== ADVANCED DISCUSSION (C1-C2) ===

SCRIPT 15: Philosophical Debate
A: I've been thinking about the impact of artificial intelligence on society. Do you think it's more beneficial or harmful?
B: That's a complex question. I'd argue it's both, depending on how we implement it. The potential benefits in healthcare and education are enormous, but there are legitimate concerns about job displacement and privacy.
A: That's a fair point. But couldn't we say that every technological revolution has caused disruption? The industrial revolution displaced workers too, yet society adapted.
B: True, but the pace of AI development is much faster. Workers had generations to adapt. With AI, it might be only years.
A: You raise a good argument. However, I'd contend that if we invest properly in education and retraining programs, we can mitigate those concerns.
B: That's idealistic, but it requires political will that I'm not sure we have. And there's also the question of who controls these technologies.
A: Ah, now that's perhaps the crux of the issue. We need robust regulation to ensure AI is developed ethically and benefits society broadly, not just corporations.
B: Exactly. The question isn't really about the technology itself, but about governance and values. We need to decide what kind of future we want.
