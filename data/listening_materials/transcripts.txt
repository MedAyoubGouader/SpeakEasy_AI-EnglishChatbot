TRANSCRIPT 8: "Educational Podcast - Climate Change"
Host: Today we're discussing climate change with Dr. Martin, a climate scientist. Dr. Martin, can you explain what causes global warming?

Dr. Martin: Certainly. The primary cause is the greenhouse effect. When we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, we release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This CO2 traps heat from the sun, similar to a greenhouse.

Host: And what are the consequences of rising temperatures?

Dr. Martin: The consequences are significant. We're seeing more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and disruption to ecosystems. Some animal species are struggling to adapt to the rapid temperature changes.

Host: What can individuals do to help?

Dr. Martin: There are many actions people can take. Reduce energy consumption by using public transportation or biking. Support renewable energy. Buy from companies that prioritize sustainability. And importantly, vote for politicians who take climate action seriously.

Host: Is it too late to prevent climate change?

Dr. Martin: We can't prevent it completely, but we can limit it. Every fraction of a degree matters. If we act now with renewable energy and reduce emissions significantly, we can prevent the worst scenarios.

ACADEMIC VOCABULARY:
- greenhouse effect (warming caused by gas accumulation)
- fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas)
- emissions (released gases)
- renewable energy (sustainable power sources)
- sustainability (meeting present needs without harming future)
